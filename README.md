# Discord.JS Bot Builder

This is a simple bot builder for Discord.JS. It is designed to be easy to use and easy to understand. It uses the package [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to ask questions and [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) to color the output. It also uses [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra) to copy the files from the template folder to the new bot folder.
